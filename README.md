## Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the winner of an Indian Premier League match based on the following inputs:

## Attributes
* Venue
* Team 1
* Team 2
* Toss winner
* Toss decision

outputs the winning team name.

## Requirements

The following packages are required to run the model:

* Pandas
* Numpy
* Sklearn
* TKinter

## Data

The training data consists of past Indian Premier League matches and their outcomes. The data has been preprocessed and transformed to feed into the machine learning model.

## Model

The machine learning model used in this project is a Logical Regression. The model has been trained and tested on the available data to achieve the best possible accuracy in predictions.

## Note

Please note that the predictions made by the model are based on past data and should not be taken as absolute truth. The actual outcome of the match may differ from the predictions.
